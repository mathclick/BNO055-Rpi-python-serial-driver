# BNO055-Rpi-python-serial-driver
No dependencies on proprietary libraries, plain and simple serial driver for Raspberry Pi
Unfortunately I2C on the RPi does not support clock stretching so the BNO055 has problems. Serial works just fine.
We simplified libraries existing online, revoving also all references to non standard libraries, to simplify use.
Enjoy
